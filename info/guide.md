  <h3 align="center">About this</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This is the ultimate guide, created by VillainsRule.<br>
    <br>
    I have made this guide for anyone to get rich in both Elements and Atoms.

  <h3 align="center">Starting Off</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This guide works with everyone at all levels.<br>
    <br>
    If you haven't made an account yet, make one. Make one alt. You are allowed one alt.

  <h3 align="center">Making Atoms</h3>

  <p align="center">
    There are a few ways to make atoms:<br>
    1. the Daily Rewards button. Redeem both account's rewards each day. Trade the alt's to your main.<br>
    2. Chatting. Become a regular in the chat, to get the best deals. Join groups such as my Guild for the best perks.<br>
    3. Trading atoms with someone else. Usually for an Element. To get the best elements, see below.<br>

  <h3 align="center">Crate Opening</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Don't hoard atoms. Opening crates is just as important.<br>
    <br>
    Finish the Metallo & Alkali crates first. These are easy.<br>
    <br>
    After that, tackle the Lanthan + Non crates. Get Holmium (and maybe Bromine) by trade, get the others from opening.<br>
    Then, tackle the Actino crate. Uranium is best VIA trade.<br>
    <br>
    Save a TON of atoms. This is when you save, save, save.<br>
    <br>
    When you have about 25K, stop saving and attack Transit with 10K. If you get Bismuth, DM me.<br>
    Use another 10K to attack the Noble crate. If you get Yellow Xenon, DM me.<br>
    The other 5K is for savings, in case you trade. Trust me, you need extra atoms sometimes.<br>
    <br>
    This is basically what I did! Enjoy!
